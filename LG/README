Router::LG
version 0.98

NAME

Router::LG - Looking Glass

DESCRIPTION

The Router::LG module is designed to let network administrators give 
outsiders the ability to execute simple arbitrary commands on routers 
for the purposes of providing information that would normally have to 
be obtained by the network administrator directly.

Users of this module should have a basic understanding of the operations 
of their routers.

INSTALLATION

1. perl Makefile.PL
2. make 
3. make test
4. make install
